# 🐍 AI Travel Agent Example – Notes & Concepts

## Section 1: Example Day Trip Itinerary – Vancouver, Canada

Planning a day trip? Here’s a sample itinerary generated by an AI agent for Vancouver, Canada:

### Morning
- **Breakfast in Gastown**: Try Canadian pancakes or a classic bagel with smoked salmon.
- **Stanley Park**: Walk or bike the scenic seawall, explore gardens, and view totem poles.

### Afternoon
- **Granville Island Public Market**: Lunch and explore artisan shops.
- **Aquabus Ride**: See False Creek and city views from the water.

### Evening
- **Capilano Suspension Bridge Park**: Walk the bridge and enjoy forest scenery.
- **Dinner at Waterfront Restaurant**: Fresh seafood and sunset views.

### Optional Activities
- Vancouver Aquarium, Yaletown, or Kitsilano neighborhoods.

> **Tip for Beginners:** These itineraries showcase how AI agents can combine local knowledge, user preferences, and practical constraints into detailed travel plans!
> **Adavanced Tip:** When starting out start small and spend more time planing out the purpose of what you want implemented. AGILE Sprints or Architectures are great starts.
> **Student Tip:** Trello is a great free option with little technical knowledge needed to setup actionable tasks.

## Section 2: AI Travel Agent with Microsoft Agent Framework (Python)

### Scenario Overview
Build an intelligent travel planning agent using Microsoft Agent Framework, powered by GitHub Models. The agent can generate personalized itineraries for random global destinations.

**Highlights:**
- Random destination selection (custom tool)
- AI-powered itinerary recommendations
- Async communication for efficiency
- Tool/function integration

### Technical Flow

```python
User Request → ChatAgent → GitHub Models API ↔ get_random_destination()
                     ↓
              Travel Itinerary Response
```

**Key Classes:**
- `ChatAgent`: Orchestrator for conversation
- `OpenAIChatClient`: Connects to GitHub Models
- `get_random_destination()`: Picks destinations

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install agent-framework-core -U
```
- Set up `.env` file with:
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  - `GITHUB_ENDPOINT`
  - `GITHUB_MODEL_ID`

### Usage Steps

1. Import libraries & load environment variables
2. Define random destination tool
3. Create and configure the agent
4. Run requests and view results

## Section 3: Semantic Kernel – Python Sample

Learn how to use the [Semantic Kernel](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/semantic-kernel) AI Framework for agentic patterns.

### Key Steps

1. **Import Packages**
   - `openai`, `dotenv`, `semantic_kernel`
2. **Create a Destinations Plugin**
   - Provides random vacation destinations
3. **Client Setup**
   - Uses GitHub Models (`gpt-4o-mini`)
4. **Agent Creation**
   - Instructions: “You are a helpful AI Agent that can help plan vacations for customers at random destinations”
5. **Run the Agent**
   - Use a `ChatHistoryAgentThread` and send a user message (e.g., "Plan me a day trip.")

### Example Plugin

```python
class DestinationsPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.destinations = [ ... ]
        self.last_destination = None

    @kernel_function(description="Provides a random vacation destination.")
    def get_random_destination(self):
        ...
```

### Main Execution

```python
async def main():
    user_inputs = ["Plan me a day trip."]
    ...
    await thread.delete() if thread else None

await main()
```

## Beginner Tips

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Most code samples use Jupyter. Learning to read and use them is a great skill—mention it in entry position interviews!
- **AI/ML Skills**: These are highly sought-after—keep learning and experimenting.
- **Important**: Errors are normal. Don’t get discouraged; research what went wrong, fix it, and try again. You learn more from mistakes!
- **GitHub/Resume Tips**:
  - Keep repos tidy with clear READMEs.
  - Show your projects and progress.
  - Highlight Jupyter and agentic work on your resume.
- **Extra Credit**: Getting other Programers/Scripters to review your code and either star it on Github, post progress on LinkedIn, or upload screen shots to a website protfolio.
