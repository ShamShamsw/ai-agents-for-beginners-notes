# 🎨 Agentic Design Patterns with GitHub Models (Python & .NET) | (And Kernel I skipped that portion for now)

---

## Introduction

This lesson goes over design patterns for robust, maintainable, and scalable intelligent agents using the Microsoft Agent Framework with GitHub Models integration. You'll learn proven patterns, human-centric UX principles, and architectural approaches for enterprise-ready agentic solutions.

---

## Learning Goals

- Understand key agentic design principles.
- Apply enterprise and production-ready patterns to your agents.
- Use guidelines for transparency, control, and consistency.
- See practical examples in both Python and .NET.

---

## Agentic Design Principles

Agents should:

- Broaden and scale human capacities (brainstorming, problem-solving, automation, etc.)
- Fill in knowledge gaps (e.g., up-to-speed on domains, translation)
- Facilitate collaboration in ways users prefer
- Make us better versions of ourselves (e.g., life coach/task master, resilience skills)

### Agent (Space)
- **Connecting, not collapsing**: Connect people, events, knowledge.
- **Easily accessible yet occasionally invisible**: Background operation, proactive when needed, multimodal, transparent.

### Agent (Time)
- **Past**: Leverage history/context for better results.
- **Now**: Nudge users at the right moment, not just notify.
- **Future**: Adapt and evolve with user interaction and technology.

### Agent (Core)
- **Embrace uncertainty but establish trust**: Show status, allow user control, be transparent.

## Guidelines for Implementing Principles

1. **Transparency**: Inform users how AI is used, show history, provide feedback channels.
2. **Control**: Allow customization, deleting data, and prompt management.
3. **Consistency**: Use standard icons, familiar UI, and multi-modal support across devices.

---

## Example: Designing a Travel Agent

- **Transparency**: Welcome message, explain capabilities, show prompt history.
- **Control**: Let users adjust prompt, verbosity, and delete conversations.
- **Consistency**: Use standard icons for actions (share, file upload, tagging).

---

## 🎯 Key Design Patterns (Python & .NET)

### Creational Patterns

- **Factory/Builder**: Standardized and fluent agent creation.
- **Singleton/DI**: Shared config and dependency injection.

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Strategy/Command**: Pluggable tools and encapsulated agent actions.
- **Observer/Template**: Event-driven workflows and standard steps.

### Structural Patterns

- **Adapter/Facade/Proxy**: Unified API, simplified interfaces, and lazy loading.
- **Decorator**: Enhanced agent capabilities.

---

## Example: Python Agent (Factory, Tool Registry, Conversation Management)

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agent_framework import ChatAgent
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient

load_dotenv()

def get_random_destination() -> str:
    destinations = [
        "Barcelona, Spain", "Paris, France", "Berlin, Germany", "Tokyo, Japan",
        "Sydney, Australia", "New York, USA", "Cairo, Egypt", "Cape Town, South Africa",
        "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "Bali, Indonesia"
    ]
    from random import randint
    return destinations[randint(0, len(destinations) - 1)]

openai_chat_client = OpenAIChatClient(
    base_url=os.environ.get("GITHUB_ENDPOINT"),
    api_key=os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN"),
    model_id=os.environ.get("GITHUB_MODEL_ID")
)

agent = ChatAgent(
    name="TravelAgent",
    chat_client=openai_chat_client,
    instructions="You are a helpful AI Agent that helps plan vacations for customers at random destinations.",
    tools=[get_random_destination]
)

thread = agent.get_new_thread()
response1 = await agent.run("Plan me a day trip", thread=thread)
print(response1.messages[-1].contents[0].text)
```

---

## Example: .NET Agent (Strong Typing, DI, Patterns)

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.Extensions.AI;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
using OpenAI;
using DotNetEnv;

Env.Load("../../../.env");

static string GetRandomDestination()
{
    var destinations = new List<string>
    {
        "Paris, France", "Tokyo, Japan", "New York City, USA", "Sydney, Australia",
        "Rome, Italy", "Barcelona, Spain", "Cape Town, South Africa", "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
        "Bangkok, Thailand", "Vancouver, Canada"
    };
    var random = new Random();
    return destinations[random.Next(destinations.Count)];
}

var github_endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("GITHUB_ENDPOINT");
var github_token = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("GITHUB_TOKEN");
var github_model_id = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("GITHUB_MODEL_ID") ?? "gpt-4o-mini";

var openAIClient = new OpenAIClient(new ApiKeyCredential(github_token), new OpenAIClientOptions { Endpoint = new Uri(github_endpoint) });
AIAgent agent = openAIClient.GetChatClient(github_model_id).CreateAIAgent(
    instructions: "You are a helpful AI Agent that can help plan vacations for customers at random destinations",
    tools: [AIFunctionFactory.Create((Func<string>)GetRandomDestination)]
);
AgentThread thread = agent.GetNewThread();
Console.WriteLine(await agent.RunAsync("Plan me a day trip", thread));
```

## 🏗️ Architectural Best Practices

- **SOLID & Clean Architecture**: Single-responsibility, interface-driven, layered separation (domain, app, infra, presentation).
- **Async/Await**: For scalable, non-blocking operations.
- **Configuration Management**: Secure credentials, environment-based setup.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Use structured logging and health checks.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests, error handling.

# Example Repo Structure: AI Agent Framework Project

If youd like to build your own I suggest something simaler to this file and folder structure for creating an AI Agent Framework project, inspired by the Microsoft ai-agents-for-beginners course (Or your own. Be Creative.).documentation, and portfolio practices.

_You can copy/adapt this structure for your own agentic AI course project. Keeping things clear and organized helps you learn, impresses recruiters, and makes it easier for others to explore your work!_

## 🔒 Enterprise Considerations

- **Security**: API key management, input/output validation, audit logging. (Please always manage your key safely)
- **Performance**: Async I/O, caching, connection pooling, resource cleanup.
- **Scalability**: Thread safety, resource pooling, monitoring.

## Beginner Tips

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Most code samples use Jupyter. Learning to read and use them is a great skill—mention it in entry interviews!
- **AI/ML Skills:** These are highly sought-after—keep learning and experimenting.
- **Important:** Errors are normal. Don’t get discouraged; research what went wrong, fix it, and try again. You learn more from mistakes!
- **GitHub/Resume Tips:**
  - Keep repos tidy with clear READMEs.
  - Show your projects and progress.
  - Highlight Jupyter and agentic work on your resume.
- **Extra Credit:** Get other programmers/scripters to review your code, star it on GitHub, post progress on LinkedIn, or upload screenshots to a portfolio.

**Need Help?**
- Watch course videos if you’re stuck.
- Join Discord for support and community.
